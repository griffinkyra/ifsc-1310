  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
  <p>
    Web Accessibility is really important to front-end creators. Here are a couple of important things I have read up on. 
    The first being contrast verse background color. With my research, I heard that "the minimun amount of contrast you can
    have between text and background is 4.5 to 1"(Reagan from TikTok). When the numbers aren't right, it makes content harder to read. 
    The second accessibility tip I picked up on is readability. You don't want to have too many pictures or links that are too small. You 
    want your site to look as clean as possible so everyone can use it. My last tip I read about was focus indicators. For instance, I have 
    my mouse hooked up and I would want to know where my cursor is. Having those indicators makes my websiste more accessbile to users who are 
    using input devices.
