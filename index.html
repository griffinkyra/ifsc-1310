  <h2>Web Accessibility Writing Assignment</h2>
  <p>
    Web Accessibility is really important to front-end creators. Here are a couple of important things I have read up on. 
    The first being contrast verse background color. With my research, I heard that "the minimun amount of contrast you can
    have between text and background is 4.5 to 1"(Reagan from TikTok). When the numbers aren't right, it makes content harder to read. 
    The second accessibility tip I picked up on is readability. You don't want to have too many pictures or links that are too small. You 
    want your site to look as clean as possible so everyone can use it. My last tip I read about was focus indicators. For instance, I have 
    my mouse hooked up and I would want to know where my cursor is. Having those indicators makes my websiste more accessbile to users who are 
    using input devices.

  <h2>Understanding Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    There's a difference between Graceful Degradation and Progressive Enhancement. 
    Graceful Degradation is kind of like IOS updates for iPhones. It's where new ideas 
    are made for a phone, but are only compatible with the lastest and greatest. If you have 
    a setting that was made seven updates ago, you will not be able to use the newest update: 
    Graceful Degradation. Progresssive Enhancement focuses on content, rather than the system 
    the user perfers. Progressive Enhancement is more about the structure rather than the 
    glitz and glammer. This is so that your content is more versatile to more people. In Web 
    Techs, we have mainly been working with Progressive Enhancement techniques. I think this 
    is very benefitcial for people who want to go this route in their career. it's a blessing 
    in disguise.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    For my reflection I asked my girlfriend, Tye, her thoughts on it. She said she thinks I could add more visuals on the home screen.
    She said that she likes my color palette, but thinks it should be more of a space-themed color palette. The boldness on the home page should 
    be consistent with the rest of the pages or remove the boldness all together. The subheading's case should also be consistent and make my case 
    format make sense. Ex: my subheading shouldn't be in all caps and primary heading aren't. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For my own thoughts, I think that this proejct was tough for me. I knew it wasn't going to be what I hoped, but I tried. 
    I think that my girlfriends right, the visuals do need to be there. As far as my text case, yes. I was mainly focusing on playing with the 
    CSS mechanics rather than making it look pretty. I had trouble trying to understand what controlled what from a CSS standpoint. What I couldn't get 
    the hang of was margins and padding. It makes sense when I was following along, but the moment I tried it by myself it went all out the window. This 
    is why my pages are all cramped together. 
  </p>
  <p>
    What I had trouble on the most was not doing the assignment. It was organizing my css.style sheet. I was struggling 
    trying to go back and find everything. Since the structure was all the same I couldn't remember what was what. I spent most of my time looking 
    back-and-forth at my html file and css page. Moving forward I will try to comment out and section out my code so it's less time consuming. I 
    had my two screens side-by-side, but that only did so much. Next time, I'll do better. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I think I did well on understanding everything we learn throughout the semester. It was a lot when I first started this project. 
    I did not know where to start. Once I got the ball rolling, my brain was tinkering. My focus was understanding where my links/labels led to. What 
    I mean by that is taking my html names and using them in css. I was type what I wanted to change in css, but when I looked at my live server nothing
    was happening. Come to find out, what I was trying to access didn't exist. One of my barriers could've been as small as I was misisng one letter or I 
    was on the wrong page. Once I understood what/where I was accessing, I was good. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am choosing not change anything about my project because it took me so long to do. I, also, am fine with the grade that I have in the class minus my 
    revisions. I have enjoyed your class Mr. Wallace. I enjoyed you as professor. You are the most engaging and uplifting professor I've ever met. You inspire 
    me to want to teach. You come into with this unique energy rather than giving off a 9-5 job. Thank you for your time and inspiring others create websites 
    good vibes.
