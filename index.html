  <h2>Web Accessibility Writing Assignment</h2>
  <p>
    Web Accessibility is really important to front-end creators. Here are a couple of important things I have read up on. 
    The first being contrast verse background color. With my research, I heard that "the minimun amount of contrast you can
    have between text and background is 4.5 to 1"(Reagan from TikTok). When the numbers aren't right, it makes content harder to read. 
    The second accessibility tip I picked up on is readability. You don't want to have too many pictures or links that are too small. You 
    want your site to look as clean as possible so everyone can use it. My last tip I read about was focus indicators. For instance, I have 
    my mouse hooked up and I would want to know where my cursor is. Having those indicators makes my websiste more accessbile to users who are 
    using input devices.

  <h2>Understanding Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    There's a difference between Graceful Degradation and Progressive Enhancement. 
    Graceful Degradation is kind of like IOS updates for iPhones. It's where new ideas 
    are made for a phone, but are only compatible with the lastest and greatest. If you have 
    a setting that was made seven updates ago, you will not be able to use the newest update: 
    Graceful Degradation. Progresssive Enhancement focuses on content, rather than the system 
    the user perfers. Progressive Enhancement is more about the structure rather than the 
    glitz and glammer. This is so that your content is more versatile to more people. In Web 
    Techs, we have mainly been working with Progressive Enhancement techniques. I think this 
    is very benefitcial for people who want to go this route in their career. it's a blessing 
    in disguise.
