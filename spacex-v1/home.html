    <h1>History</h1>
    <!--(Primary Content Heading)-->
  <p>
    SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 
    to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <h3>Cargo - Resupply the Space Station</h3>
    <h4>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES</h4>
    <p>
      Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and currently 
      the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Dragon accommodates 
      pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.
    </p>
    <h5>Crew - Taking Humans into Space></h5>
    <h4>PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA</h4>
    <p>
      Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to space. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making 
      upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability.
    </p>
    <h4>CREW UPGRADES</h4>
    <p>
      Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew transport vehicle, with seating for seven, life-support 
      systems, controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape system.
    </p>
    <h4>FIRST LAUNCH</h4>
    <p>
      Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first manned test flight is expected to take place 
      as early as 2018.
    </p>
    <h5>Dragon Lab - A FREE-FLYING MICROGRAVITY LABORATORY</h5>
    <h4>FACILITATING RESEARCH</h4>
    <p>
      DragonLab is a free-flying, unmanned platform designed for research and testing in a microgravity 
      environment independent of the International Space Station.
    </p>
    <h4>LONGEVITY</h4>
    <p>
      It can transport payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors into space and back to Earth on 
      missions ranging from one week to two years.
    </p>
    <h4>CAPABILITIES</h4>
    <p>
      DragonLab can readily accommodate instrument and sensor testing, space physics and relativity experiments, 
      radiation effects research, and many other microgravity tests.
